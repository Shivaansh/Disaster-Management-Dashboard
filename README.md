This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Task:

This project was part of an assignment given to us as part of our Human Computer Interfaces course in the Fall 2020 term. We are asked to create a dashboard for viewing and analyzing social media posts resulting from a disaster that are fed to the application via a web socket, and to allow filtering these posts on the basis of type and severity. (See the PDf file for full details on the assignment)

## To Run the code

### Only the `frontend` directory contains the work done by me. 
The server package (provided by the course faculty, not to be modified) is used to provide the data for this application.
 
Therefore, before running the application, the server needs to be started. For this, Node.js needs to be installed.
Visit [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node.js

1) Navigate to the `server` directory.
2) Run `node server.js`
3) The server will start up. 

Next, we need to run the React application itself. For this, you need to have npm installed. Visit [https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install npm.

1) Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2) Run `npm install`
3) Run `npm start`
3) The application should start on `localhost`in your default browser.
